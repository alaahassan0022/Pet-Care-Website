                        Annual examinations are as essential as food and love. Don’t wait for your pet to be sick before taking him to the veterinarian. Bring your pet in for a wellness exam at least once a year. Older pets and pets with medical issues may need to be seen more frequently. Your veterinarian will examine your pet from head to tail to insure he is healthy and up to date on immunizations and other preventives. In the long run these annual checkups will save you money and heartache by protecting your pet from preventable diseases and by detecting illness early when it is more treatable. Taking your pet to the veterinarian for an annual wellness exam is the best way to ensure your pet lives a long, healthy life.

                        Most people wouldn’t skip vaccinating their kids and shouldn’t overlook vaccinating their pets. Immunizations protect our pets from devastating diseases caused by viruses and bacteria. As a shelter vet, I see too many animals suffering needlessly from preventable diseases like distemper and parvovirus. Ask your veterinarian to find out which vaccines would benefit your pet based on his lifestyle and risk factors, and how often your pet should receive booster vaccines.

                        <span style=" font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">3. Screening tests</span> <br />


                        Since animals can’t talk and tell us what is wrong with them, screening tests are important because they can detect disease before signs and symptoms develop. Depending on your pet’s age, your veterinarian will recommend screening tests to look for problems like diabetes, kidney disease or thyroid disease. Make sure you get the screening tests recommended by your veterinarian even if your pet looks healthy. Your veterinarian may also recommend screening tests before your pet undergoes general anesthesia to ensure they are healthy enough for the procedure.

                        Commit to keeping your pet’s teeth clean and healthy. What does this entail? First, take your pet to the veterinarian for a checkup, and cleaning if necessary, at least once a year. Second, brush his teeth regularly with pet toothpaste and give him dental chews to help keep his teeth pearly white in between visits. Routine dental care can not only help keep your pet’s teeth clean and healthy but also help prevent painful and costly dental problems in the future.

                        Parasites are a common and important cause of disease in pets. They can be internal, like worms and protozoa, or external, like fleas and ticks. Besides making you cringe, parasites can cause significant morbidity in pets and can lead to death in the case of heartworm disease and Lyme disease, to name just two. Parasites can even pose a danger to other family members such as children. Fortunately, parasitic disease is easy to prevent. Speak with your veterinarian to ensure you are protecting your pets and family from internal and external parasites by using monthly preventatives year round.
